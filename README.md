# spandex

A text expander extension for Chromium, a  school project. 

## Objective
People write text all day, everyday. Some long sentences they type in over and over again, sentences like "laughing out loud", and that's what we want to fix for the user. Our plugin, _spandex_, can expand little keywords (like "lol") into full sentences (like "laughing out loud"). These keywords can be configured by the user.

Let's take an example. Jonathan Van Wunderbar is an avid Facebook user. Let's assume that he writes the sentence "laughing out loud" three-hundred times a day. That is a total of 5100 characters Jonathan has to type, for that sentence alone, each day! Using spandex, he can configure the keyword "lol" to be expanded to "laughing out load". Then he'll type the keyword "lol" three-hundred times a day, or a total of 900 keys typed. That is only 18% of what Jonathon would otherwise have to type!

As you can see, this extension is a total lifesaver.

## About Us
We love to expand text, and often like to refer to ourselves as text expanders, or just "expandas". We are also ex-pandas (see included pictures).
